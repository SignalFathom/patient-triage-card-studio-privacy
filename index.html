  <h1>Privacy Policy — Patient Triage Card Studio</h1>
  <div class="muted">Effective Date: October 21, 2025</div>

  <p><strong>Patient Triage Card Studio</strong> (“the App”), developed by Signal Fathom LLC, is a mobile application for emergency-management training and triage simulation.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not collect, transmit, sell, or monetize personal information to Signal Fathom LLC.
    All data you enter (such as names, triage details, or exercise notes) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>
    and within files you generate (e.g., PDFs).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Account Sign-In (Firebase Authentication):</em> If you choose to sign in, we collect your email solely to authenticate your account through Firebase Authentication.
    We do not sell, share, or use this information for any other purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The App may request limited device permissions (such as file access) to generate and save PDFs.
    No information is sent to our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    All files remain on your device unless you choose to share or back them up.
    Signal Fathom LLC does not access your data.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because data remains on your device, you control access. For training scenarios that include sensitive content,
    we recommend deleting files after exercises.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for adult training use and is not directed to children under 13.
