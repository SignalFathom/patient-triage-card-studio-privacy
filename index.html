  <h1>Privacy Policy — Patient Triage Card Studio</h1>
  <div class="muted">Effective Date: December 04, 2025</div>

  <p><strong>Patient Triage Card Studio</strong> (“the App”), developed by Signal Fathom, LLC, is a mobile application for emergency-management training and triage simulation.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not collect, transmit, sell, or monetize personal information to Signal Fathom, LLC.
    All training data you enter (such as names, triage details, or exercise notes) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>
    and within files you generate (for example, PDFs).
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Account Sign-In (Firebase Authentication):</em> If you choose to sign in, your email address is used only to authenticate your account through Firebase Authentication and to send password reset emails.
    We do not sell, share, or use this information for any other purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    Firebase Authentication may also process security and technical metadata (such as device and network information) to protect accounts and prevent abuse.
    Signal Fathom, LLC does not receive or use this information for advertising or analytics.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The App may request limited device permissions (such as access to storage) to generate, save, and open PDF files.
    Triage card content is not sent to Signal Fathom, LLC; it remains on your device or wherever you choose to store or share your files.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    • Account data (your email and authentication details) is stored in Firebase Authentication on Google infrastructure.<br>
    • Exercise content and generated PDFs are stored locally on your device or in locations you choose (for example, cloud drives or email if you share or back up files).
  </p>
  <p>
    We share data only with service providers needed to run the App:
    Google Firebase Authentication for account creation, sign-in, password reset, and security. Google acts as our processor for these functions.
    We do not otherwise disclose personal data unless required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We rely on Firebase’s security controls (such as encryption in transit and hardened infrastructure) and take reasonable measures to protect account data.
    You are responsible for securing your device, managing access to generated PDFs, and following your organization’s policies for storing or deleting training materials.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Account data (your email and associated Firebase identifiers) is kept while your account remains active.
    When you delete your account, Firebase Authentication removes your user record for Patient Triage Card Studio.
    Any PDFs or exercise files you have created remain wherever you stored them and are under your control to keep or delete.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Reset password:</strong> Use the in-app “FORGOT PASSWORD” option on the login screen to receive a reset email from Firebase Authentication.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Delete account in-app:</strong> If you have access to the App, you can delete your account by opening the Settings screen and using the
    “DEACTIVATE ACCOUNT” button. You will be asked to confirm with your password. This will delete your Firebase Authentication account for Patient Triage Card Studio
    and remove the account information we control. You remain responsible for deleting any PDFs or exercise files you have generated.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If you cannot delete your account through the App:</strong> If you no longer have access to your device or the App but need to delete your account,
    you can request account deletion by contacting us from the email address associated with your account:
  </p>
  <p>
    Email: <a href="mailto:SignalFathom@gmail.com">SignalFathom@gmail.com</a><br>
    Subject line suggestion: “Account deletion – PATIENT TRIAGE CARD STUDIO”
  </p>
  <p>
    This web page also serves as the online location where users can obtain instructions for account deletion if they cannot access the App.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Subscriptions and Billing</h2>
  <p>
    If you purchase a subscription to Patient Triage Card Studio through Google Play, billing and subscription management are handled by Google.
    Deleting your account in this App does <strong>not</strong> cancel your Google Play subscription.
    To stop future charges, you must manage or cancel your subscription directly in the Google Play Store under <em>Payments &amp; Subscriptions</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for adult professional training use and is not directed to children under 13.
    Training exercises that simulate pediatric patients are for educational purposes only and should always follow your organization’s policies and applicable laws.
